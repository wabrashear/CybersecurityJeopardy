This program launches a web-based application for a Jeopardy-style game. Once launched, open a browser and navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000 and select the number of players/groups who are playing.

The categories and questions can be easily modified by changing the contents of the provided csv file. The init_db.py script will need to be run anytime this file is edited for the game to be updated with the new questions or categories.
